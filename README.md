This is my personal fork of @beanaroo's display-visor.

**Changed:**
* xrandr commands to handle DP1, eDP1 and HDMI1;
* udev rule;
* space quantity because I hate 4 spaces but that's just me.

Refer to the original repository for detailed documentation: [display-visor](https://github.com/beanaroo/display-visor).
